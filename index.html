        <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
        <p>ACT provides in-community (55 and older) free self-serve farmer markets to remote 	locations, senior living apartments, mobile home courts and facilities across 	Pierce, Thurston, Lewis and King County.  We call ourselves “Produce Wranglers” as 	we serve a fabulous buffet of produce, fruits and vegetables which we gleaned and 	purchased from local farmers and small businesses all over Washington.  Our 	distribution model allows seniors and people with disabilities the right to choose 	food which meets their dietary and cultural needs.  Our model allows for us to go to 	them, creates avenues for independence, socialization and even an opportunity for 	volunteerism.  We haul, drop and distribute produce the same day, priding ourselves 	on pick up, distribution and in the homes within 4 hours. While our focus is seniors 	and handicapped we never turn anyone away.</p>
